------------std::vector------------
1) std::vector is a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays

Create a vector containing integers
    std::vector<int> v = {7, 5, 16, 8};
or 10 int element with value =0
    std::vector<int> my_vector(10, 0);
or
std::vector<std::string> game_state(5, std::string(5, '.'));
game_state[0][0] = '|';
game_state[5][5] = '|';

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
If we have a function that is called in a for loop and within them we need to
declare some variables, the smartest thing to do is to declare these variables
as static. This way they are only created once. It would have the same effect as
declaring in the global scope.

///////////////////Threads////////////////////////////

Avoid to writte in a global variable from more than one thread. It happends that
the one thread read an old value from this variable.

The solution to this problem is to lock the variable while one thread use this
global variable. Disavangtage from that is that the other threads muss be paused.
